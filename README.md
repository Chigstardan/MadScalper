# MadScalper
One of my fun implementation of a crypto currency trading bots I made for scalping the 5 min timeframe, The bot used the python wrapper for the binance API.
I used technical indicators that was calculated by the pandas_ta library. You can also use TA or TA-Lib for your technical indicators.
This repo is just to give you an idea on how to implement your own trading strategy algorithm for your own trading bot.
